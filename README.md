# Deployment Blocker: React Compatibility Issue

## The Problem

I'm currently facing a deployment blocker with my Next.js dashboard application. When trying to deploy to Vercel, the build fails due to a compatibility issue between the latest React version and Radix UI components.

### Error Details

```
Failed to compile.

./node_modules/@radix-ui/react-use-effect-event/dist/index.mjs
Attempted import error: 'useEffectEvent' is not exported from 'react' (imported as 'React').

Import trace for requested module:
./node_modules/@radix-ui/react-use-effect-event/dist/index.mjs
./node_modules/@radix-ui/react-use-controllable-state/dist/index.mjs
./node_modules/@radix-ui/react-toggle-group/dist/index.mjs
./components/ui/toggle-group.tsx
./components/chart-area-interactive.tsx
```

## Root Cause

This issue is caused by a version mismatch:

1. The project uses React 19, which is very recent
2. Several Radix UI components (particularly toggle-group) depend on an internal React feature called `useEffectEvent`
3. While this hook exists in React's codebase, it's not officially exported in the current stable version

## Resolution Plan

I'm working on resolving this by:

1. Downgrading React to version 18.2.0
2. Downgrading Radix UI components to versions that don't rely on this unstable React feature
3. Updating the build configuration to ensure compatibility

## Timeline

I expect to have this resolved within 24-48 hours. Once fixed, the dashboard will be deployed and fully functional with all interactive features working as designed.
